# Analyzing Bias in the Chicago Crime Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains a detailed analysis of bias within the Chicago Crime Dataset, conducted as part of the **CS 5891: Responsible AI** course. The dataset provides records of reported crimes in Chicago, and this analysis aims to identify and quantify biases in crime reporting, arrest patterns, and law enforcement focus.

## Contents
- **`Analyzing Bias in the Chicago Crime Dataset.docx`** – The final report documenting the analysis, including methodologies, statistical findings, and recommendations.
- **`Jupyter Notebook/`** – Contains the Chicago Crime Dataset used for analysis, Python scripts for data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization, Charts and graphs illustrating biases in the dataset.

## Key Findings
- **Geographical Bias** – Certain police districts report crime at nearly **3x** the rate of others, suggesting over-policing.
- **Temporal Bias** – Seasonal and hourly patterns indicate that crime is underreported at night and peaks in summer.
- **Crime Type Bias** – Street crimes are disproportionately reported compared to financial or cybercrimes.
- **Arrest Bias** – Arrest rates vary significantly by crime type, indicating potential law enforcement disparities.

## Tools Used
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)** for data processing and statistical analysis.
- **Data Cleaning & Bias Detection** techniques applied to highlight discrepancies in reporting.

## Recommendations
- **Improve transparency** in law enforcement reporting.
- **Balance data collection** by supplementing police reports with community-based data.
- **Consider ethical AI principles** when using this dataset in predictive models.
